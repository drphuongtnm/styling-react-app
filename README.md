# My React CSS Playground

Hey there! This is a super simple React project I threw together to get a feel for different ways to style components. I wanted to see how vanilla CSS, inline styles, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS stack up against each other in a real, basic React app.

## What's Inside?

Basically, I've got a few simple components, each styled using a different method:

- **Vanilla CSS:** Just regular CSS files, like the old days.
- **Inline Styles:** Styling directly in the JSX, which can get messy fast!
- **Styled Components:** Using `styled-components` for those fancy CSS-in-JS vibes.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Trying out that utility-first approach.

## Why I Made This

I wanted to get a hands-on feel for the pros and cons of each styling approach. I've heard a lot about each of them, and this was my way of seeing it for myself.

## How to Run It

1.  **Clone this repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repo_url>
    cd react-css-playground
    ```

2.  **Install the stuff:**

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Fire it up:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

4.  **Check it out:**

    Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

## What to Look For

- See how each component is styled.
- Notice the differences in the code.
- Think about which method you'd prefer for different situations.

## My Thoughts

This little project helped me see the strengths and weaknesses of each CSS method. I'm still learning, but it was a fun way to experiment! Feel free to fork it and play around yourself!
