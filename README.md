# React CSS Testing Project

This project is a simple React application designed to demonstrate and compare different CSS styling methods:

- **Vanilla CSS (Regular CSS files):** Using standard CSS files imported into React components.
- **Inline Styling:** Applying styles directly within the JSX elements.
- **Styled Components:** Utilizing the `styled-components` library for component-level styling.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Employing the utility-first CSS framework Tailwind CSS.

## Purpose

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Styled Components:** CSS-in-JS library.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework.
- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** For package management.
